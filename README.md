# LangChain Conversational Memory Example

## Summary
This project demonstrates how to use LangChain to implement conversational memory in a chatbot application. It shows how to integrate a language model with components that manage the conversational context, allowing for more coherent and context-aware responses.

## Usage
1. **Install LangChain**: The notebook begins with the installation of the LangChain library.

2. **Import Libraries**: The necessary libraries, including components from LangChain, are imported.

3. **Setup Language Model and Conversation History**: The language model is initialized (using a placeholder for GPT-3 in this example) along with a conversation history component.

4. **Create a Chain with Components**: A LangChain is created with components that handle the conversational history and the language model.

5. **Implement Conversational Loop with Memory**: The notebook demonstrates how to run a conversational loop that continually updates and utilizes the conversation history for generating context-aware responses.

To interact with the AI, input text as prompted. Type 'quit' to exit the conversation loop.
